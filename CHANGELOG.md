# 3.6

## AS3
 * **Breaking changes**
  * Removed `Bone.worldToLocalRotationX` and `Bone.worldToLocalRotationY`. Replaced by `Bone.worldToLocalRotation` (rotation given relative to x-axis, counter-clockwise, in degrees).
  * Made `Bone` fields `_a`, `_b`, `_c`, `_d`, `_worldX` and `_worldY` public, removed underscore prefix.
  * Removed `VertexAttachment.computeWorldVertices` overload, changed `VertexAttachment.computeWorldVertices2` to `VertexAttachment.computeWorldVertices`, added `stride` parameter.
  * Removed `RegionAttachment.vertices` field. The vertices array is provided to `RegionAttachment.computeWorldVertices` by the API user now.
  * Removed `RegionAttachment.updateWorldVertices`, added `RegionAttachment.computeWorldVertices`. The new method now computes the x/y positions of the 4 vertices of the corner and places them in the provided `worldVertices` array, starting at `offset`, then moving by `stride` array elements when advancing to the next vertex. This allows to directly compose the vertex buffer and avoids a copy. The computation of the full vertices, including vertex colors and texture coordinates, is now done by the backend's respective renderer.
  * Replaced `r`, `g`, `b`, `a` fields with instances of new `Color` class in `RegionAttachment`, `MeshAttachment`, `Skeleton`, `SkeletonData`, `Slot` and `SlotData`.
 * **Additions**
  * Added `Skeleton.getBounds` from reference implementation.
  * Added support for local and relative transform constraint calculation, including additional fields in `TransformConstraintData`
  * Added `Bone.localToWorldRotation`(rotation given relative to x-axis, counter-clockwise, in degrees).    
  * Added two color tinting support, including `TwoColorTimeline` and additional fields on `Slot` and `SlotData`.
  * Added `PointAttachment`, additional method `newPointAttachment` in `AttachmentLoader` interface.

### Starling
 * Fixed renderer to work with 3.6 changes.
 * Added support for two color tinting.

## C
 * **Breaking changes**
  * `spVertexAttachment_computeWorldVertices` and `spRegionAttachment_computeWorldVerticeS` now take new parameters to make it possible to directly output the calculated vertex positions to a vertex buffer. Removes the need for additional copies in the backends' respective renderers.
  * Removed `spBoundingBoxAttachment_computeWorldVertices`, superseded by `spVertexAttachment_computeWorldVertices`.
  * Removed `spPathAttachment_computeWorldVertices` and `spPathAttachment_computeWorldVertices1`, superseded by `spVertexAttachment_computeWorldVertices`.
  * Removed `sp_MeshAttachment_computeWorldVertices`, superseded by `spVertexAttachment_computeWorldVertices`.
  * Removed `spBone_worldToLocalRotationX` and `spBone_worldToLocalRotationY`. Replaced by `spBone_worldToLocalRotation` (rotation given relative to x-axis, counter-clockwise, in degrees).
  * Replaced `r`, `g`, `b`, `a` fields with instances of new `spColor` struct in `spRegionAttachment`, `spMeshAttachment`, `spSkeleton`, `spSkeletonData`, `spSlot` and `spSlotData`.
 * **Additions**
  * Added support for local and relative transform constraint calculation, including additional fields in `spTransformConstraintData`.  
  * Added `spPointAttachment`, additional method `spAtlasAttachmentLoadeR_newPointAttachment`.
  * Added support for local and relative transform constraint calculation, including additional fields in `TransformConstraintData`
  * Added `spBone_localToWorldRotation`(rotation given relative to x-axis, counter-clockwise, in degrees).  	
   * Added two color tinting support, including `spTwoColorTimeline` and additional fields on `spSlot` and `spSlotData`.
  * Added `userData` field to `spTrackEntry`, so users can expose data in `spAnimationState` callbacks.
  * Modified kvec.h used by SkeletonBinary.c to use Spine's MALLOC/FREE macros. That way there's only one place to inject custom allocators ([extension.h](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/blob/master/spine-c/spine-c/include/spine/extension.h)) [commit](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/commit/c2cfbc6cb8709daa082726222d558188d75a004f)

### Cocos2d-X
 * Fixed renderer to work with 3.6 changes
 * Optimized rendering by removing all per-frame allocation in `SkeletonRenderer`, resulting in 15% performance increase for large numbers of skeletons being rendered per frame.
 * Added support for two color tinting. Tinting is enabled/disabled per `SkeletonRenderer`/`SkeletonAnimation` instance. Use `SkeletonRenderer::setTwoColorTint()`. Note that two color tinting requires the use of a non-standard shader and vertex format. This means that skeletons rendered with two color tinting will break batching. However, skeletons with two color tinting enabled and rendered after each other will be batched.
 * Updated example to use Cocos2d-x 3.14.1.
 * Added mesh debug rendering. Enable/Disable via `SkeletonRenderer::setDebugMeshesEnabled()`.

### Cocos2d-Objc
 * Fixed renderer to work with 3.6 changes
 * Added support for two color tinting. Tinting is enabled/disabled per `SkeletonRenderer/SkeletonAnimation.twoColorTint = true`. Note that two color tinted skeletons do not batch with other nodes.

### SFML
 * Fixed renderer to work with 3.6 changes. Sadly, two color tinting does not work, as the vertex format in SFML is fixed.

### Unreal Engine 4
 * Fixed renderer to work with 3.6 changes
 * Added new UPROPERTY to SpineSkeletonRendererComponent called `Color`. This allows to set the tint color of the skeleton in the editor, C++ and Blueprints. Under the hood, the `spSkeleton->color` will be set on every tick of the renderer component.

## C#
 * **Breaking changes**
  *  `MeshAttachment.parentMesh` is now a private field to enforce using the `.ParentMesh` setter property in external code. The `MeshAttachment.ParentMesh` property is an appropriate replacement wherever `.parentMesh` was used.

### Unity
 * Fixed renderer to work with 3.6 changes.
 * Two color tinting is currently supported via extra UV2 and UV3 mesh vertex streams. To use Two color tinting, you need to:
  * switch on "Tint Black" under "Advanced...",
  * use the new `Spine/Skeleton Tint Black` shader, or your own shader that treats the UV2 and UV3 streams similarly.
 * `SkeletonAnimator` now has autoreset set to true by default. Old prefabs and scene values will have been serialized to whatever value it was previously. This change only applies to new instances of SkeletonAnimator.
 * Old triangle-winding code has been removed from `SkeletonRenderer`. Please use shaders that have backface culling off.
 * The code in the example scripts have been switched over to using properties instead of fields. This is in anticipation of both users who want to move the Spine folders to the Unity Plugins folder (compiled as a different assembly), and of Unity 2017's ability to manually define different assemblies.
 * Warnings and conditionals checking for specific Unity 5.2-and-below incompatibility have been removed.
 * `AtasRegionAttacher` and `SpriteAttacher` are now part of `Example Modules`, to reflect that they are meant to be used as sample code rather than production.
 * In the unitypackage, the "spine-csharp" and "spine-unity" folders are now inside a "Spine" folder. This change will only affect fresh imports. Importing the unitypackage to update Spine-Unity in your project will update the appropriate files wherever you have moved them.

## Java
 * **Breaking changes**
  * `Skeleton.getBounds` takes a scratch array as input so it doesn't have to allocate a new array on each invocation itself. Reduces GC activity.
  * Removed `Bone.worldToLocalRotationX` and `Bone.worldToLocalRotationY`. Replaced by `Bone.worldToLocalRotation` (rotation given relative to x-axis, counter-clockwise, in degrees).
  * Added `stride` parameter to `VertexAttachment.computeWorldVertices`.
  * Removed `RegionAttachment.vertices` field. The vertices array is provided to `RegionAttachment.computeWorldVertices` by the API user now.
  * Removed `RegionAttachment.updateWorldVertices`, added `RegionAttachment.computeWorldVertices`. The new method now computes the x/y positions of the 4 vertices of the corner and places them in the provided `worldVertices` array, starting at `offset`, then moving by `stride` array elements when advancing to the next vertex. This allows to directly compose the vertex buffer and avoids a copy. The computation of the full vertices, including vertex colors and texture coordinates, is now done by the backend's respective renderer.
 * **Additions**  
  * Added support for local and relative transform constraint calculation, including additional fields in `TransformConstraintData`
  * Added `Bone.localToWorldRotation`(rotation given relative to x-axis, counter-clockwise, in degrees).  
  * Added two color tinting support, including `TwoColorTimeline` and additional fields on `Slot` and `SlotData`.  
  * Added `PointAttachment`, additional method `newPointAttachment` in `AttachmentLoader` interface.
  * Added `ClippingAttachment`, additional method `newClippingAttachment` in `AttachmentLoader` interface.

### libGDX
 * Fixed renderer to work with 3.6 changes
 * Added support for two color tinting. Use the new `TwoColorPolygonBatch` together with `SkeletonRenderer`
 * Added support for clipping. See `SkeletonClipper`. Used automatically by `SkeletonRenderer`. Does not work when using a `SpriteBatch` with `SkeletonRenderer`. Use `PolygonSpriteBatch` or `TwoColorPolygonBatch` instead.

## Lua
 * **Breaking changes**
  * Removed `Bone:worldToLocalRotationX` and `Bone:worldToLocalRotationY`. Replaced by `Bone:worldToLocalRotation` (rotation given relative to x-axis, counter-clockwise, in degrees).
  * `VertexAttachment:computeWorldVertices` now takes offsets and stride to allow compositing vertices directly in a vertex buffer to be send to the GPU. The compositing is now performed in the backends' respective renderers. This also affects the subclasses `MeshAttachment`, `BoundingBoxAttachment` and `PathAttachment`.
  * Removed `RegionAttachment:updateWorldVertices`, added `RegionAttachment:computeWorldVertices`, which takes offsets and stride to allow compositing vertices directly in a vertex buffer to be send to the GPU. The compositing is now performed in the backends' respective renderers.
  * Removed `MeshAttachment.worldVertices` field. Computation is now performed in each backends' respective renderer. The `uv` coordinates are now stored in `MeshAttachment.uvs`.
  * Removed `RegionAttachment.vertices` field. Computation is now performed in each backends respective renderer. The `uv` coordinates for each vertex are now stored in the `RegionAttachment.uvs` field.
 * **Additions**
  * Added `Bone:localToWorldRotation`(rotation given relative to x-axis, counter-clockwise, in degrees).
  * Added two color tinting support, including `TwoColorTimeline` and additional fields on `Slot` and `SlotData`.
  * Added `PointAttachment`, additional method `newPointAttachment` in `AttachmentLoader` interface.  
  * Added support for local and relative transform constraint calculation, including additional fields in `TransformConstraintData`

### Love2D
  * Fixed renderer to work with 3.6 changes
  * Added support for two color tinting. Enable it via `SkeletonRenderer.new(true)`.

### Corona
  * Fixed renderer to work with 3.6 changes. Sadly, two color tinting is not supported, as Corona doesn't let us change the vertex format needed and its doesn't allow to modify shaders in the way needed for two color tinting

## Typescript/Javascript
 * **Breaking changes**
  * `Skeleton.getBounds` takes a scratch array as input so it doesn't have to allocate a new array on each invocation itself. Reduces GC activity.
  * Removed `Bone.worldToLocalRotationX` and `Bone.worldToLocalRotationY`. Replaced by `Bone.worldToLocalRotation` (rotation given relative to x-axis, counter-clockwise, in degrees).
  * Removed `VertexAttachment.computeWorldVertices` overload, changed `VertexAttachment.computeWorldVerticesWith` to `VertexAttachment.computeWorldVertices`, added `stride` parameter.
  * Removed `RegionAttachment.vertices` field. The vertices array is provided to `RegionAttachment.computeWorldVertices` by the API user now.
  * Removed `RegionAttachment.updateWorldVertices`, added `RegionAttachment.computeWorldVertices`. The new method now computes the x/y positions of the 4 vertices of the corner and places them in the provided `worldVertices` array, starting at `offset`, then moving by `stride` array elements when advancing to the next vertex. This allows to directly compose the vertex buffer and avoids a copy. The computation of the full vertices, including vertex colors and texture coordinates, is now done by the backend's respective renderer.
 * **Additions**  
  * Added support for local and relative transform constraint calculation, including additional fields in `TransformConstraintData`
  * Added `Bone.localToWorldRotation`(rotation given relative to x-axis, counter-clockwise, in degrees).  
  * Added two color tinting support, including `TwoColorTimeline` and additional fields on `Slot` and `SlotData`.  
  * Added `PointAttachment`, additional method `newPointAttachment` in `AttachmentLoader` interface.
  * Added `ClippingAttachment`, additional method `newClippingAttachment` in `AttachmentLoader` interface.
  * Added `SkeletonClipper` and `ConvexDecomposer`, used to implement software clipping of attachments.

### WebGL backend
 * Fixed WebGL context loss
   * Added `Restorable` interface, implemented by any WebGL resource that needs restoration after a context loss. All WebGL resource classes (`Shader`, `Mesh`, `GLTexture`) implement this interface.
   * Added `ManagedWebGLRenderingContext`. Handles setup of a `WebGLRenderingContext` given a canvas element and restoration of WebGL resources (`Shader`, `Mesh`, `GLTexture`) on WebGL context loss. WebGL resources register themselves with the `ManagedWebGLRenderingContext`. If the context is informed of a context loss and restoration, the registered WebGL resources' `restore()` method is called. The `restore()` method implementation on each resource type will recreate the GPU side objects.
   * All classes that previously took a `WebGLRenderingContext` in the constructor now also allow a `ManagedWebGLRenderingContext`. This ensures existing applications do not break.
   * To use automatic context restauration:
    1. Create or fetch a canvas element from the DOM
    2. Instantiate a `ManagedWebGLRenderingContext`, passing the canvas to the constructor. This will setup a `WebGLRenderingContext` internally and manage context loss/restoration.
    3. Pass the `ManagedWebGLRenderingContext` to the constructors of classes that you previously passed a `WebGLRenderingContext` to (`AssetManager`, `GLTexture`, `Mesh`, `Shader`, `PolygonBatcher`, `SceneRenderer`, `ShapeRenderer`, `SkeletonRenderer`, `SkeletonDebugRenderer`).
 * Fixed renderer to work with 3.6 changes.
 * Added support for two color tinting.
 * Improved performance by using `DYNAMIC_DRAW` for vertex buffer objects and fixing bug that copied to much data to the GPU each frame in `PolygonBatcher`/`Mesh`.
 * Added two color tinting support, enabled by default. You can disable it via the constructors of `SceneRenderer`, `SkeletonRenderer`and `PolygonBatcher`. Note that you will need to use a shader created via `Shader.newTwoColoredTexturedShader` shader with `SkeletonRenderer` and `PolygonBatcher` if two color tinting is enabled.
 * Added clipping support

### Canvas backend
 * Fixed renderer to work for 3.6 changes. Sadly, we can't support two color tinting via the Canvas API.
 * Added support for shearing and non-uniform scaling inherited from parent bones.
 * Added support for alpha tinting.

### Three.js backend
 * Fixed renderer to work with 3.6 changes. Two color tinting is not supported.
 * Added clipping support

### Widget backend
 * Fixed WebGL context loss (see WebGL backend changes). Enabled automatically.
 * Fixed renderer to work for 3.6 changes. Supports two color tinting & clipping (see WebGL backend changes for details).
 * Added fields `atlasContent`, `atlasPagesContent`, and `jsonContent` to `WidgetConfiguration` allowing you to directly pass the contents of the `.atlas`, atlas page `.png` files, and the `.json` file without having to do a request. See `README.md` and the example for details.
